# Terfenol-Galfenol-Based-RF-MEMS-Switch-Design-Using-COMSOL-Multiphysics
Recent advances in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have accelerated the evolution of high-performance, low-power switching solutions for next-generation radio frequency (RF) front-ends. Conventional electrostatically actuated RF MEMS switches offer low insertion loss and high isolation but suffer from high actuation voltage, contact reliability issues, and charge trapping effects, limiting their operational lifespan and integration capability. This research introduces an optimised RF MEMS switch utilising magnetostrictive actuation to replace high-voltage electrostatic driving. The proposed design uses thin-film magnetostrictive materials—specifically Terfenol-D (Tb₀.₃Dy₀.₇Fe₂) and Galfenol (Fe-Ga alloys)—to actuate a planar cantilever through a magnetic field generated by an integrated coil. The study presents a comprehensive multi-physics analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the mechanical, magnetic, and structural behaviour of the MEMS switch under various driving currents and geometries. Comparative results demonstrate that Terfenol-D provides superior magnetostrictive strain (up to 2000 ppm) and displacement (~350 nm), offering powerful actuation but with higher mechanical stress and brittleness. Conversely, Galfenol exhibits lower strain (~400 ppm) and displacement (~80 nm), but delivers better mechanical stability, ductility, and manufacturability. We explore the trade-offs between actuation force, energy efficiency, and material reliability, providing actionable design insights into how these materials can be deployed for RF MEMS switches in critical applications, including 5G/6G reconfigurable antennas, high-speed tunable filters, and implantable biomedical RF systems. Fabrication strategies, including sputtering, patterning, and integration with CMOS-compatible processes, are discussed in detail. Additionally, we introduce enhancements such as structural pre-biasing, stress-engineered beams, and composite magnetostrictive layers to extend performance. The proposed design demonstrates strong potential for low-power, high-cycle operation with improved thermal and mechanical stability.
